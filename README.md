### What I learned

During the process of coding this project, I had issues with adding google fonts to my css and I learnt how to implement it successfully after a few tries, got stuck with the image rounded corners because my code was not working as I expected it too, had to revisit my border-radius knowledge to get the hang of it. Overall, it was a pretty fun process relearning and implementing everything I've once learnt.
